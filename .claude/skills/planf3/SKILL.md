# Plan F3

## Purpose

Create a detailed, **HTML-first** implementation plan based on the `USER_PROMPT` variable. The plan is authored as a single self-contained `.html` page so it can be opened in a browser, embed focused Excalidraw diagrams with a synced visual identity, and be created/updated/consumed by the agent trifecta (engineer, team, AI agents). Analyze the request, think through the implementation approach, follow the `## Instructions`, and work through the `## Workflow` to produce the plan from the `## Plan Template`.

## Variables

USER_PROMPT: $1
QUESTIONABLE: $2 - default false
PLAN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY: `specs/`
PLAN_FILE: `PLAN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/<descriptive-kebab-name>.html`
IMAGES_OUTPUT_DIR: `PLAN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/<plan-name>/`
AI_DOCS: `AI_DOCS/`
APP_DOCS: `APP_DOCS/`
IDE: `code`
BROWSER: `chrome`

## Instructions

- IMPORTANT: If no `USER_PROMPT` is provided, stop and ask the user to provide it
- Carefully analyze the user's requirements provided in the `USER_PROMPT` variable
- Think deeply (ultrathink) about the best approach to implement the requested functionality or solve the problem
- Explore the codebase to understand existing patterns, documentation, previous specs and architecture
- The plan is **HTML-first**: produce a single self-contained `.html` document from the `## Plan Template` below
- The template uses `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` variables — replace EVERY `{{...}}` with real content. Do not leave any `{{}}` token in the final file
- Blocks marked with `<!-- repeat -->` are repeatable: duplicate them as many times as the plan needs (e.g. one block per phase, task, file, or Q&A entry) and delete the comment markers
- Keep the document self-contained: all CSS lives in the single `<style>` block; do not link external stylesheets or scripts
- Visuals are **Excalidraw diagrams**, not AI-generated raster art. Each diagram is a simple, straightforward box/arrow/flow drawing authored as an editable `.excalidraw` source file and rendered to a PNG (locally, no API key). Keep designs clean, minimal, and professional — easy to map out at a glance.
- Maintain a **synced visual identity** between the html styling and the diagrams. We want a professional, focused, minimal theme based on the original `USER_PROMPT` that created the plan. The CSS custom properties in `:root` define the palette/typography. Every diagram must use the same palette so the rendered PNGs sit naturally inside the page.
- For every diagram, focus on one or two primary ideas. Keep total words shown under ~10 — boxes, arrows, and short labels only. The goal is diagrams that aid the plan and convey the core information for the section they belong to.
- Build diagrams for professional software engineers to convey exactly what is going to be built. Be sure to center and space them properly.
- Embed diagrams via the `{{...IMAGE}}` slots. During Create, leave them as commented placeholders noting the intended subject; the Diagram Generation workflow fills them later
- Populate the metadata header (`created`, `modified`, `commits`, `agent`, `session`, back/forward references) — these are updatable across the plan's lifecycle. Every metadata field except `CREATED_ISO` is a comma-separated list that must only ever be appended to — never overwrite or remove existing entries
- If `QUESTIONABLE` is true, actively surface open questions/assumptions in the toggleable Q&A section rather than silently deciding
- Ensure the plan is detailed enough that another developer (or agent) could follow it to implement the solution
- Include code examples or pseudo-code where appropriate to clarify complex concepts
- Consider edge cases, error handling, and scalability concerns
- Save the complete plan to `PLAN_FILE` using a descriptive kebab-case filename

## Workflow

Based on the `USER_PROMPT`, select the single best-matching workflow below and read its file for the step-by-step instructions before acting.

| Workflow | When to call it | File to read |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create Plan | The prompt asks to plan, spec, or design new work and no existing plan is referenced | `workflows/create-plan.md` |
| Update Plan | The prompt asks to change, extend, or revise the content of an existing plan | `workflows/update-plan.md` |
| Update References | The prompt asks to refresh plan metadata or back/forward references (created, modified, commits, agent, session) | `workflows/update-references.md` |
| Build Plan | The prompt asks to implement, execute, or carry out the work described in an existing plan | `workflows/build-plan.md` |

### Subworkflow

Called by other workflows rather than selected directly from the `USER_PROMPT`.

| Subworkflow | When it's called | File to read |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Diagram Generation | Invoked by other workflows (e.g. Create Plan) to generate, fill, or regenerate the embedded Excalidraw diagrams in a plan | `workflows/diagram-generation.md` |
