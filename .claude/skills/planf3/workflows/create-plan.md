# Create Plan

1. Analyze Requirements - THINK HARD and parse the `USER_PROMPT` to understand the core problem and desired outcome
2. Explore Codebase - Understand existing patterns, architecture, relevant files, and prior specs to back-reference. Read `AI_DOCS` for AI/agent-facing documentation and `APP_DOCS` for application documentation to ground the plan.
3. Design Solution - Develop technical approach including architecture decisions and implementation strategy
4. Author HTML Plan - Fill the `## Plan Template`, replacing every `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` and repeating `<!-- repeat -->` blocks as needed
5. Generate Diagrams - Run the Create sub-workflow in `workflows/diagram-generation.md` to fill the `{{...IMAGE` slots with Excalidraw diagrams. Author the diagrams one at a time (the render step is fast and local).
6. Surface Questionables - If `QUESTIONABLE` is true, populate the conditional Questionables section with open decisions/assumptions/risks; otherwise omit the section
7. Generate Filename - Create a descriptive kebab-case filename based on the plan's main topic
8. Save - Write the plan to `PLAN_FILE` and provide a summary of key components
9. Open in Browser - Open the saved plan in `BROWSER` (e.g. `open -a "Google Chrome" PLAN_FILE`)
